# Introduction


## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will learn how to deploy Oracle Globally Distributed Database with RAFT replication. You will also deploy an application base on the RAFT with high availability. 

Estimated Lab Time: 4 hours.

### About Oracle Globally Distributed Database

Oracle Globally Distributed Database disperses segments of a data set across many databases (shards) onto different computersâ€”on-premises or in the cloud. It enables globally distributed, linearly scalable, multimodel databases. It requires no specialized hardware or software. Oracle Globally Distributed Database does all this while rendering the strong consistency, full power of SQL, support for structured and unstructured data, and the Oracle Database ecosystem. It meets data sovereignty requirements and supports applications that require low latency and high availability.



## About RAFT Replication

RAFT Replication enables rapid failover within seconds and zero data loss during node or data center outages, facilitating an Active-Active-Active symmetric distributed database architecture that enhances availability, simplifies management, and optimizes resource utilization globally.
